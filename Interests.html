        <p1>I have alot of interests because I like to try new things. As said in the about me page I love learning languages and learning about cultures. I love music which is
            why I play the cello and the guitar. I just love the way music can make you feel. I also love reading and am a writer. I love expresing my thoughts ideas and imagination
            on paper. Transforming it into a story for otheres to enjoy. I am super interested in strange foods and spicy tastes. I see programming as something to challenge me
            and make me a more well-rounded person. A multiple trick pony XD.
