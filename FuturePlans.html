        <p class="main">My plan for the future isnt quite as mapped out as I would like it to be. Because I have so many interests and talents I dont know exactly what I would like to
            be and what would be a great job for me. I have given thought to multiple options that are of interest to me. A translater, a intellagence officer for the marines,
            cryptologic linguist for the army, behavior analasyst for the bau, a surgoun, a musician, and a computer programmer. And those are not all of them. As you can see 
            there is a veriety of different kinds of careers. One thing I do know is that I dont want to be trapped behind a desk. I want to be a protector. I want to help
            and protect people who cant protect themsleves. I want to do something that will mean something to me and the world. <em>I want to make a difference in my future</em>.
